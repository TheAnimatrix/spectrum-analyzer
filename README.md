**SPECTRUM ANALYZER**
----------------------

'Just another readme file for another new project' - Adithya Angara

This is our minor project for the college . Basically our objective is to build a modular portable spectrum analyzer , which can easily be reconfigured to work with a variety of different signals and visualize their frequencies on a display of sorts.

the data should also be wired to the cloud where it can be used to act as an input for any control system (mostly software at this point like a game)

The inputs could be :

1.sound waves \n
2.light with the help of a ccd \n
3.eeg , emg [Hello OPAMPS!] \n
4.whatever you want. \n

yeah that's a pretty good summary imo . (according to the current me , wait for me to read it again a while later and i'm sure i wont say the same)
